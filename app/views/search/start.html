        <h2 class='nhs-heading-l'>About this prototype</h2>

        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          This prototype explores alternatives styles, layouts and navigation for the product.
        </p>

        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          Our initial work on layout and navigation was done using the dashboard view. When we tried to implement these designs on our search page, we realised the styles didn't marry up and so we chose to re-explore some concepts which would join the 'Search'
          and the 'Patient dashboard' views together.
        </p>

        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          Our previous research concluded that of the versions we tested, the 'white tabs' were the preferred style for navigating the product. For this reason we will test a similar version using white tabs with some subtle alterations to fit the patient
          search pages.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class='nhs-heading-l'>Why test again?</h2>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          When we began to explore concepts for the search functionality of the SCRa redesign, we realised that the work we had done surrounding layout and navigation (whilst working nicely for the patient dashboard view) didn't work well with our search pages.
        </p>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          It is reasonable to assume that the search functionality will be a main feature of the product redesign. Without an efficient search functionality, we believe users would struggle to locate the patient (and subsequently that patient's information) easily.
        </p>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          For these reasons, we will re-look at the style, layout and navigational elements of the product in a manner that works with search as well as the patient dashboard. We will make us of the findings we have already acquired, whilst exploring some further ideas.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2 class='nhs-heading-l'>Hypotheses</h2>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          <strong>If</strong> we create a layout that looks and navigates the same on search and patient views
        </p>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          <strong>Then</strong> users will find it easier to navigate the product
        </p>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          <strong>Because</strong> the product will behave similarly regardless of what page the user is on.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          <strong>If</strong> we create a visual identity for the product
        </p>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          <strong>Then</strong> users will have confidence in using the product
        </p>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          <strong>Because</strong> they will recognise the product as an NHS designed and developed system.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          <strong>If</strong> we test a version based on feedback garnered from earlier iterations
        </p>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          <strong>Then</strong> the feedback we gain on this iteration will be as reliable as possible
        </p>
        <p class="nhsuk-body">
          <strong>Because</strong> we are testing alternate designs using knowledge we have already acquired from our users, placing their needs at the forefront of any designs.
