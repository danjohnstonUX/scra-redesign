      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        This prototype explores the introduction of edit functionality within the redesigned SCRa.
      </p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        This feature allows those users with the correct RBAC permissions to edit a patient's demographics details. The ability to edit details exists in existing SCRa, so we are reimplementing it using the new UI.

      <h3 class='nhs-heading-m'>Version 2 prototypes</h3>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        We have revisited the initial designs from November of 2019 and updated them with feedback from both users and clinical safety sessions ready to re-test ahead of development.
      </p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        We aim to test navigation within the 'Edit' screen as users told us they wanted an up-front view of all the sections that were available to edit for a particular area of the patients details, as well as the ability to cancel in progress
        amendments and remove previous amendments.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h3 class='nhs-heading-m'>Version 2 hypotheses</h3>

      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>If</strong> we add the editable sections to our navigation components
      </p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>Then</strong> users will be able to see which details are avaiable to edit as soon as they land on the page, and can then subsequently navigate to the relevant section
      </p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>Because</strong> our navigation components are always visible.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>If</strong> we provide a 'cancel' button for users who have accidentally chosen to add new information to a patient's record
      </p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>Then</strong> users will be confident that they have not made any accidental, unnecessary changes to a patient's PDS record
      </p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>Because</strong> the 'cancel' button will allow them to stop what they are doing and return to the previous state.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>If</strong> we provide a 'remove' button for previously entered information which can be removed
      </p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>Then</strong> users will be able to quickly amend old, unnecessary or out of date information without having to manually delete information using their keyoard.
      </p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>Because</strong> the 'remove' button will perform this action for them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>If</strong> we ask users to confirm their changes after clicking the 'Save' button at the bottom of the Edit page
      </p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>Then</strong> users will be confident that they have not made any mistakes when amending a patients' data
      </p>
      <p class="nhsuk-body">
        <strong>Because</strong> we show the users what the information has changed from and to before they commit to saving the information on Spine, and allow them to cancel any changes that do not look correct.
