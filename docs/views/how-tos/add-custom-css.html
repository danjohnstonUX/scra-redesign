      <h2>Sass</h2>

      <p>The prototype kit uses SCSS syntax of <a href="http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#syntax">Sass</a> to write CSS.</p>

      <p>Sass is an extension of CSS that gives a load of extra features useful in producing CSS for the mass of different devices and browsers.</p>

      <p>You can paste CSS into it without breaking it which is useful for prototyping.</p>

      <h2>Adding your own Sass or CSS</h2>

      <p>You write your Sass in <strong>app/assets/sass</strong>, and it gets compiled into the CSS used in your page (found in <strong>/public/css</strong>).</p>

      <p>There is already a CSS file included called <strong>main.scss</strong> which compiles into <strong>main.css</strong>.</p>
      
      <div class="nhsuk-inset-text">
        <p>Note that Sass files are identified by the <strong>.scss</strong> extension.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Each time you make a change in <strong>main.scss</strong> it will create a new version of <strong>main.css</strong>.</p> 
      <p>Make sure to write your css in <strong>main.scss</strong> as anything you put in <strong>main.css</strong> will get overridden.</p>
